### Problem List
#1. Write a Python program to find the largest number in a list.
List=[3,5,3,1,4,2]

r=max(List,key=lambda x:x)
print(r)
#2. Write a Python program to find the smallest number in a list.
r=min(List,key=lambda x:x)
print(r)
#3. Write a Python program to sum all numbers in a list.
from functools import reduce
r=reduce(lambda x,y:x+y,List)
print(r)
#4. Write a Python program to multiply all numbers in a list.
r=reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,List)
print(r)
#5. Write a Python program to count the number of strings in a list where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are the same
ListStr=["cat","is","eating","banana","from","the","it","tree","i"]
r=list(filter(lambda x:len(x)>=2,ListStr))
print(len(r))
